# MWO4_Helper
Status: Alpha

### Description:
Its a script to fix issues with my Oblivion Mod Collection, typically the folder structure is incorrect, because the mods were not created when a Vortex was invented. 

### Clarification:
1. Sets working directory to script location. (because we are running it as admin)
2. Prints MWO4 header.
3. Checks for admin rights; exits if not admin. (so there are no issues with moving files)
4. Verifies .\data folder exists; exits if missing. (incase its in the wrong folder)
5. Deletes .\Data\OBSE\Plugins\OBSE_Kyoma_MenuQue.dll if present. (because this is a dummy file that causese issues)
6. Moves Travelersâ€™ Cloaks ESP from nested folder to .\Data. (fix wrong folder structure)
7. Moves Version.dll from .\Data to root. (fix wrong folder structure)
8. Reports whether all 4 Elys Silent Voice files are in .\Data\obse\plugins. (fix wrong folder structure)
9. Pauses before exiting.

## Instructions:
1. Ensure your computer has `Scripting Host` as `Enabled`. If you cant run scripts, then try a tool like `XP-AntiSpy` to `Enable` it.
2. You are intended to Install/Update the collection first, so that it has the mods with the vanilla errors.
3. Copy/Extract the `MWO4_Helper.bat` script directly into the `~\Oblivion` folder.
4. Run the `MWO4_Helper.bat` script as admin, and let it do its thing.
5. Check the results (as it pauses at the end). If errors occur, they will likely be straight forward to fix.
